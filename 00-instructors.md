## [Matt Fisher](https://mfisher87.github.io)

**Research Software Engineer @ [Schmidt Center for Data Science and Environment, UC Berkeley](https://dse.berkeley.edu/)**

I'm an open source contributor and maintainer with a background in geospatial data, the
cryosphere, and accessibility. I help maintain
[earthaccess](https://earthaccess.readthedocs.io/) to enable access to NASA data in 3
lines of code.
I'm also a community manager, leading the
[GeoJupyter](https://geojupyter.org/) project to make working with geospatial data more
approachable and enjoyable for all.
