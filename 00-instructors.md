## [Matt Fisher](https://mfisher87.github.io)

**Research Software Engineer @ [Schmidt Center for Data Science and Environment, UC Berkeley](https://dse.berkeley.edu/)**

I'm an open source contributor and maintainer with a background in geospatial data, the
cryosphere, and accessibility. I help maintain
[earthaccess](https://earthaccess.readthedocs.io/) to enable access to NASA data in 3
lines of code.
I'm also a community manager, leading the
[GeoJupyter](https://geojupyter.org/) project to make working with geospatial data more
approachable and enjoyable for all.

## [Max Jones](https://github.com/maxrjones)

**Cloud Engineer @ [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org/)**

I build open-source solutions that enable change on a global scale as an engineer at
Development Seed. I enjoy increasing the accessibility of data that drives decision-making and
particularly love solving geospatial problems. I serve on the editorial board for the Cloud Native
Geospatial Forum (founding member), the Pangeo Steering Council, and contribute to many scientific
Python libraries. At the moment, I'm focused on optimizing delivery of NASA datasets using Virtual Zarr.
I'm also currently improving my skills in Kubernetes and Rust.
