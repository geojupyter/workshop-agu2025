# 🐕 Dogfooding our processes

["Dogfooding" or "eating our own dog food"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)
refers to the practice of using our own product.
This is important because it enables us to continuously test the same experience that
our users will use on the day of the workshop.
