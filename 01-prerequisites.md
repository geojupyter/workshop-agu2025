# 🚦 Prerequisites

This workshop requires a few prerequisites:


## A computer with a web browser installed

All activities in this workshop will be performed in a cloud computing environment
called [CryoCloud](https://cryointhecloud.com/).

**The only thing you need to have installed to participate is a web browser**!
This means you can participate even on a Chromebook or a locked-down corporate computer.


## A GitHub account

Please [sign up for a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) if you haven't already.


## Complete the CryoCloud onboarding process

Follow the
[CryoCloud "getting started" documentation](https://book.cryointhecloud.com/getting-started)
to gain access to CryoCloud.


### ⚠️ Critical: Accept the invitation to join the CryoCloud team

Once we have your github ID, we will send you an invitation to join a GitHub team that
will give you access to log in to CryoCloud.
**You must accept that invitation within 7 days!**

* [Click here to accept your invitation](https://github.com/orgs/CryoInTheCloud/invitation).
  You should see a simple page with a big green button to accept.
  If you don't, it's possible you already accepted your invitation, possibly by e-mail.
* [Log in to CryoCloud](https://hub.cryointhecloud.com/).
  If you see a "403 Forbidden" error, you don't have the correct access.
  Let a workshop organizer know, and give them your GitHub username, and we'll fix it
  right up!
  * You will see a dialog to "Authorize nasa-cryo-prod" on your first login.
    **Click the green "Authorize 2i2c-org" button**.
